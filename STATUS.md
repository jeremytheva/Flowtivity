# Status

Project Master 1.0 operating controls are adopted without changing product scope.

## Next dependency-correct work
Integrate the current implementation PR, then resume only roadmap/issue/defect-backed work.

## Provider governance
Firebase provider configuration is not provider or application certification. Persisted behaviour must be verified explicitly before production-safety claims.
